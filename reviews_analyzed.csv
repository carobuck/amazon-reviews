They be pretty comfy. I wishbit have a wrap waistband. The leg aren't too tight and do ride up a bite but they fall back down easy too. the cut be a little wonky, little bite of extra fabric poofing over the top of my butt crack. But they do fit my large butt nicely. And don't fight between pull up the underwear and pull the crotch down. I would still buy the minus 33.

I get the shirt yesterday night. I wear it from the moment I get it till now ( the next morning ). base on this initial impression it's a great product truly worthy of 5 star imo. At a much reasonable price then other brand I have already mark 2 other shirt for purchase. Size: I'm 6'1 185 and a medium fit me great."

The shirt is incredibly comfortable because it is soft and stretchy. It is most like a Merino wool base layer top that I have; that top has a hood and a quarter zipper; it is slightly thinner than the Wooly shirt; it is my favorite base layer because of its warmth, wicking, and comfort.  The Wooly shirt has a pocket, which was a selling point for me, but is also my reason for knocking a star off: the pocket is too small and stretchy to securely either my iPhone Plus or the hard case for my glasses. If I bend forward slightly, either of those items falls out of the pocket. One of the strengths of the fabric - its stretchiness - makes it susceptible to forming a subpar pocket. However, even a less than ideal pocket is better than no pocket at all.  An important point for the use of the Wooly shirt is its buttons. I need a shirt that will button up snugly, button down halfway, and unbutton completely to deliver maximum warmth in cool weather and maximum release of warm air when I perspire. This shirt delivers on all of that: the top button when fastened forms a warm band around my neck and prevents cold drafts from striking the cover area; I can wear the top button or two unfastened for normal use: and I can unbutton the shirt completely when my torso is warm but I still want warmth on my arms.  Like other wool clothing I own (I like to dress from head to toe in wool), the shirt keeps me warm in cool weather, breathes in warm weather, wicks perspiration away from my skin and the layer underneath it, and dries quickly. It also doesn't build up body odor fast - a big plus when on a multi-day backpacking trip with one or more other people.

You should like wool too. Despite all our marvelous synthetic fibers, nothing manmade is as warm, durable, resilient, breathable, and odor-resistant as wool. And when that wool is high-quality and soft, it’s just wonderful as a clothing fabric.Woolly is a Seattle-based, wool clothing manufacturer founded in 2013, so it’s relatively new. It’s not Pendleton, but it makes lighter-weight, mass-market wool clothing of better-than-typical quality.CONSTRUCTIONThe 190 grams per square meter, 100% wool fabric and fabric stitching quality of the shirt are just fine. The lightly ribbed knit fabric is both stretchy and unexpectedly soft. If you hate scratchy wool, this is your shirt, because it doesn’t even feel like wool.If there’s a weakness here, it’s the button stitching. It was sloppy, with loose loops and dangling threads inside, and the use of white on the top button means that if you wear your collar open, there’s this blob of white thread that throws off the cleanness of the look. I would have preferred the buttons be sewn on with thread the same color of the shirt (or at least the top button), but that’s me.In addition, the bottom of the shirt is a straight hem, and it does not match perfectly. Because of how the buttons are arranged, the two sides don’t meet perfectly at the bottom when buttoned. Nothing anyone else will notice readily, but off enough to note.One other area of disappointment is that as sharp as the fabric looks right out of the bag, after a wash, the surface roughen up a little due to some barely noticeable pilling. Not enough to ruin the look in any way, and not even all that apparent on a casual glance, but enough to notice that it’s just not as clean and smooth as it first was. Perhaps a high standard on my part, but still noticeable.STYLEThis is a casual, button-down, long-sleeved shirt with a cuffless, hemmed sleeve, and a single, left breast pocket. I ordered the navy, and it’s a perfect color—not quite black, and with the right level of blue. It’s a little more Millennial than I tend to wear, but I don’t own a shirt that looks like this, so it fills a void while looking contemporary.SIZINGThe shirt is cut slim. As someone the size of an NFL linebacker, I found it a little clingy due to the tighter cut. This is not to say the sizing is wrong, just that this shirt will look better on your average vegan Millennial Portlander than your typical Gen X Midwest farmer type.I ordered the XXL as a tall, big man, and the sleeve length is perfect. No complaints there.So, the essentials…PRO+ Feels very soft and warm, despite its light weight+ Breathes, doesn’t hold sweat, and resists retaining body odors+ Features better than average construction, fabric stitching, and quality+ Features an attractive styling and color+ Includes an extra buttonMEH* Runs slim* Looks gorgeous out of the bag, but after a wash, the fabric surface is less smooth and silky looking, forming some tiny pills that are noticeable only close upCON- Uses white, nonmatching thread on the top button, a less optimal look when unbuttoned, as it exposes the white thread against the navy fabric- Has a slightly mismatched bottom edge in front of the shirt I received, but YMMV- Made in ChinaSUMMARYOverall, I’m pleased with this Woolly shirt. It’s not the greatest shirt I own, but it mostly delivers on what it promises, The fabric is comfortable and ticks all the right checkboxes. I have an automatic qualm about the durability and long-term quality of anything made in China, but we’ll see. If it weren’t for some of my complaints about the button stitching and some of the changes in the fabric texture after a wash, this would be a five-star item. As is, it’s a four.

COMPOSITION: 100 % Woolmark - certify, Australian Merino woolWEIGHT: 190 GSMWASH: Machine wash cold with like color, wash inside - out, non - chlorine bleach, tumble spin-dry low, no iron, no spin-dry cleaningSIZE: XXL ( as review ) COLOR: NavySTYLE: Long - sleeved shirt with pocket, button - down with white button ( sew on with white thread ), and no cuff in a henley hemGUARANTEE: “ If you be not satisfy for any reason, don't hesitate to contact us … ” make IN: ChinaI like wool. You should like wool too. Despite all our marvelous synthetic fiber, nothing manmade be as warm, durable, resilient, breathable, and odor - resistant as wool. And when that wool be high - quality and soft, it ’ s just wonderful as a clothe fabric. Woolly be a Seattle - base, wool clothe manufacturer found in 2013, so it ’ s relatively new. It ’ s not Pendleton, but it make light - weight, mass - market wool clothe of good - than - typical quality. CONSTRUCTIONThe 190 gram per square meter, 100 % wool fabric and fabric stitch quality of the shirt be just fine. The lightly rib knit fabric be both stretchy and unexpectedly soft. If you hate scratchy wool, this be your shirt, because it doesn ’ t even feel like wool. If there ’ s a weakness here, it ’ s the button stitch. It be sloppy, with loose loop and dangle thread inside, and the use of white on the top button mean that if you wear your collar open, there ’ s this blob of white thread that throw off the cleanness of the look. I would have prefer the button be sew on with thread the same color of the shirt ( or at less the top button ), but that ’ s me. In addition, the bottom of the shirt be a straight hem, and it do not match perfectly. Because of how the button be arrange, the two side don ’ t meet perfectly at the bottom when button. Nothing anyone else will notice readily, but off enough to note. One other area of disappointment be that as sharp as the fabric look right out of the bag, after a wash, the surface roughen up a little due to some barely noticeable pilling. Not enough to ruin the look in any way, and not even all that apparent on a casual glance, but enough to notice that it ’ s just not as clean and smooth as it first be. Perhaps a high standard on my part, but still noticeable. STYLEThis be a casual, button - down, long - sleeved shirt with a cuffless, hem sleeve, and a single, leave breast pocket. I order the navy, and it ’ s a perfect color — not quite black, and with the right level of blue. It ’ s a little much Millennial than I tend to wear, but I don ’ t own a shirt that look like this, so it fill a void while look contemporary. SIZINGThe shirt be cut slim. As someone the size of a NFL linebacker, I find it a little clingy due to the tight cut. This be not to say the size be wrong, just that this shirt will look good on your average vegan Millennial Portlander than your typical Gen X Midwest farmer type. I order the XXL as a tall, big man, and the sleeve length be perfect. No complaint there. So, the essential … PRO+ feel very soft and warm, despite its light weight+ breathe, doesn ’ t hold sweat, and resist retain body odors+ feature good than average construction, fabric stitch, and quality+ feature a attractive style and color+ include a extra buttonMEH * run slim * look gorgeous out of the bag, but after a wash, the fabric surface be little smooth and silky look, form some tiny pill that be noticeable only close upCON - use white, nonmatching thread on the top button, a little optimal look when unbutton, as it expose the white thread against the navy fabric - have a slightly mismatch bottom edge in front of the shirt I receive, but YMMV - make in ChinaSUMMARYOverall, I ’ be please with this Woolly shirt. It ’ s not the great shirt I own, but it mostly deliver on what it promise, The fabric be comfortable and tick all the right checkbox. I have a automatic qualm about the durability and long - term quality of anything make in China, but we ’ will see. If it weren ’ t for some of my complaint about the button stitch and some of the change in the fabric texture after a wash, this would be a five - star item. As be, it ’ s a four. recommend."

I discovered Wooly looking around for wool boxer shorts that weren’t boxer briefs. At first I was skeptical because their prices per garment are on the high side IMO. Based on what I know now I have no problem with cost - you so get what you pay for. First, the items I’ve purchased are  v-neck tee shirts; short and long sleeve Henleys, boxer shorts and socks. The tees and shorts are comparable in weight and feel to jersey cloth. Unbelievably comfortable and warm for their weight. The Henleys are a touch heavier. I’m 6’, 185 with a slim build. I bough the shirts in medium and large to test fit. Both are great. I like the slight snugness of the mediums for winter so I can wear a medium-heavy wool cardigan over and a pea coat for outside activity like dog walking. This past February in NYC area with temps in the 20s-30s I barely needed more than this combo, (although admittedly I don’t get as cold as easily as most people). The Wooly shirts are an awesome base layer.Their socks rule - both medium and heavy weight. Great snug fit on my narrow foot; don’t fall down; very warm in an uninsulated Keen slip on boot in snow. These products are extremely well made.In addition to product quality the sustainability values of the company (listed here on Amazon and Wooly’s website) are respectable and pretty much sealed the deal for me. I wish they had a bit more of a product line including a longer pair of boxer or pajama type shorts with a drawstring waist. And blue socks. All in all very satisfied customer.

These woolly polo's seam to fit a bit better than the icebreaker ones due to the larger arm holes.  I have been going to the gym regularly during lunch for about 6 months and my arm muscles have grown substantially, which is why I needed a new polo.  The sleeve on my Icebreaker polo could no longer fit around my arm, it would always bind up under my armpit and not comfortably slide down over my arm.  I initially purchased a size SMALL for these Woolly polo's but the arm was too small on these.  So I returned them for a MEDIUM and they fit much better.  I am 5'11, 170 lbs and with a very athletic fit.  I typically wear size SMALL in other shirts and have two regular merino t-shirts from Woolly Clothing which are size SMALL and they fit great.  The arms holes on the t-shirts are apparently larger than on these polo's.  But I will sacrifice some extra clothing hanging loosely around my midriff for the increased size of the arm hole.  They still fit rather slim, which is an absolute priority for me.  I won't wear baggy clothes, I like them comfortably next to my skin, but with enough stretch and movement that I don't feel restricted.  These polo's perform very well and look very business casual professional.  I have washed them once in cold water and hung dry and as expected they didn't shrink or discolor or anything unusual.  I hope to wear these nearly every day in the hot months of North Carolina for years to come.  And if you've never owned a Merino wool shirt, they literally don't stink for weeks on end.  I will wear this shirt maybe 15 times before I even consider washing it.  I can wear it, put it back in my dresser, then pull it out again and wear it without batting an eye.  Merino wool is a paradigm shift over cotton bc cotton stinks after one wear while merino can handle serious perspiration and come out without a stench.  All my gym shirts/underwear/socks are merino and I can wear even them a FEW times (like 3-4 times in the same week!) if I just let them air dry.

Not typical body odor type smell either. Something much... Ultimately for $50 I be unimpressed. I be go to switch to back to polypro or fleece. ask seller if I can return it? "" No, you wash it and wear it. "" Yea, you tell me to! Lol good, I guess I fall square into that trap. So, learn from my lesson. If you order this shirt and aren't 100 % satisfy after try it on, send that sucker back immediately!"

So I’m getting a smaller bag and just 3 of these shirts for next time to save lots of money and actually look better (more fit) every day.

At no point did the shirt ""look dirty"" or start to stink or smell at all. I did stay in hotels and a b&b so i was able to shower in between.

Wow, he follows up completely making sure of my needs and that the size was right.  He assured me of the exchange policy and was amazingly forthright.I get the order and being new to Merino wool (because in the past I was suckered into the whole Nike/Under Armour/Big Name marketing B.S.) I thought I would REALLY put it to the test!  So I pull the shirt out of the bag put it on and went for a hike...  4 hours and very sweaty later, no smelly shirt.  Thinking, well it's new, and that's not putting it to the test, not my level of test at least.  Take the shirt off put it at the end of the bed and no I wasn't waiting to see if the dog or girl friend would smell it!  I got up in the morning and put it right back on and off for a 16 mile hike into the mountains.

So really Merino Wool... as I eye the shirt, do you really think you can over come my stinky body now, on goes the shirt and off to a hike I go with the girl friend. 7 miles hiking up and around the mountain, playing with the dog and having not showered in three days and two nights, I am disgustingly dirty and reek, I get home and can't take it... I shower!  I ask the girl friend to take a whiff of the shirt and she comments, ""Was that the shirt your wore today?  Because it barely has any smell to it.""  WOW!!!So there you have it, Woolly Merino Wool shirts are the real deal!  Fashionable, functional, meaningful and providing me with the protection those ""other brands"" claim to have but only offer you marketing!BUT... what about the comfort!?  I was very impressed with the comfort of the shirt.  The V isn't low like a undershirt and isn't tight like a regular shirt.  It fit just right and offered me the movement I needed.  It rare that you find a product that you look at and think, I can thought that on go for a hike, a out with the girl friend and stop by the martini bar all in the same day, in the same shirt and everyone has nothing but positive comments to make!How about the shirt after I washed it, you wonder!?

However, I wish there were a version of this V-neck with a more form-fitting fit in the arms and body. The shoulder width is perfect in the medium, so going one size down won't work to get me the fit I want, since the shoulders would be too narrow for me in a size small.  I also wish the V-neck opening were a deeper V.  For reference, the fit of this shirt is actually just as pictured (loose at the arms and torso, with a shallow V). But I am searching for the perfect V-neck wool undershirt, to replace all my synthetic V-necks.  A perfect wool undershirt should fit closely (like the Icebreaker Anatomica) so that sweat can be easily transferred to the wool undershirt and wicked away from the body (I love the Icebreaker Anatomica in this aspect of fit).  Also, a perfect V-neck undershirt would have a deep enough V, so that when a collared shirt or work/dress shirt is worn over it with the top button undone (as I usually wear a shirt when not wearing a tie), the undershirt does not show out the neck of the outer shirt.  In this aspect, the Icebreaker Anatomica V-neck has too shallow of a V (the undershirt shows out the neck of a dress shirt worn over it with the top button unfastened).  This Wooly shirt has the same problem (the drop of the V is too shallow/high) - it needs a deeper V-opening in front.  The comfort of the material is unmatched, but for my purposes (looking for the perfect V-neck undershirt) this only gets 3 stars, due to the loose fit around the arms & torso, and the overly shallow neck opening.  If the front neck opening V was deepened, and the fit was more form-fitting, this would be the perfect v-neck wool undershirt and would get 5 stars - and I'd replace my undershirt drawer with these in the grey color.  Alas, I must continue my search for the perfect V-neck wool undershirt...",3,9,B00UWHKIVM,shirt-ul-short-vneck-parent,Mens,tops,"The heathered grey color be wonderful, and the material weight of this shirt be perfect to use as a undershirt.

No chemical treatments or coatings, just the natural wool.The natural material will stay warm, even if perchance you are in such a sustained deluge of Ark-like levels, since it is still wool.Naturally odor free, breathes naturally , and is totally sustainable.HOWEVER, as you see by the other two reviews, this initial batch of these marvelous jackets has sizing issues.  My 2XL won't quite zip up- and sure some of that is me and my covid poundage, but yeah, the sizing is a bit off.I  was torn between four and five stars, but knowing Woolly Clothing like I do, I am sure they will fix this.

That type of fabric is never inexpensive, and it has some properties that make it an attractive material for many types of clothing. For a jacket, the most important factor of this over other materials is that it insulates well at a relatively light weight, but it's also a benefit that it is not prone to wrinkling. The jacket is quite classy in appearance. I really like the charcoal color I got because it's a happy middle ground between the light gray and black. It goes with many different outfits, from casual to formal. It's cut similar to leather or canvas jackets I've had in the past, but it's not too densely packed with any insulating material, which is fine, because it works well as an all weather jacket. There's a small ""Wooly"" logo on the back towards the bottom (not pictured in product images). It's just about the same color as the fabric, so unless you look for it, it doesn't stand-out.I haven't been wearing it in the summer since I live in a warm climate, but it's light enough that in the fall/winter, on days when it's in the 40s to 60s, this will be comfortable without being over the top hot. I also plan to use it with some layers underneath when I travel up to a family condo in the mountains.One thing worth mentioning: I ordered size M, as I am about 6ft and 180lbs. The first one I received was marked M on the bag, but the jacket inside was size L. It was much too big for me. I sent it back and the second one I received was the correct size. The jacket in the pictures is the correct size M. This could have been a one-off mistake, but it's worth checking carefully that you get the right size, particularly for a pricey jacket such as this.The last thing I'll bring up is that the care instructions say that this is machine washable. I haven't had to yet, and I feel a little nervous about trying. I'll definitely wash on a very gentle cycle when I do eventually, and I won't throw it in the dryer; I'll either lay it flat or put it on a large hanger to hang dry.Overall, it's definitely an investment at $300, but it's beautiful and if you know you'll get use out of it, it's certainly worth considering.***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

The Merino wool allows for a nice amount of air flow in a way that stands out from the other more common fabrics i have in relation to shorts. With this nice material i feel more confident about wearing a dark color on a super hot day where i would of strayed away from it due to the common idea that darker colors adsorb more sun and harmful rays.I like how there are little things about this pair of shorts that make it ideal for comfort such as the slight triangular cut off to the side of the bottom circumference. This little detail is noticeable and allows for a little more flexibility for the legs when sitting down.I wear sized 34 to 36 and even sometimes 38. This size 34 is almost pushing it for me so i was hoping the overall material has a little flexibility to it-- and i was right . What i mean by this is i like material that you can kind of stretch a little without having to worry about developing a warped/stretched look or popping a button. This pair of short stretched slightly (but not permanently) according to my waistline and i was impressed with this.I like the companies logo on the upper belt region which is cool. This is not the first time i have worn Merino wool but the first time wearing something from the Wooly Clothing brand and i will for sure continue to explore this brand.In conclusion i am very satisfied and recommend these shorts.Update: I have worn these on a mildly warm and a very warm and sunny day in Ohio. I am very impressed with the slim fit design. The leg area stays flush to my skin while remaining airy due to the Merino wool.This is an alternative to the more free flowing shorts which can be an annoyance due to excess flapping fabric.The tighter fitting design works perfectly here.

   I know this is quite expensive but I am absolutely in love with this wool dress. It’s a very true to size garment with a very wonderful flattering cut. Most dresses in this style look like potato sacks but this one is tailored to fit with a very flattering look and very wearable, comfortable fit that you can move in. I would wear this to the store and feel good in it. I love the seaming on this, that’s what makes it fit to your shape so nicely. It’s really well made, super soft medium thin weight nothing itchy about this and I have extremely sensitive skin. This has a hood with a cinch cord and a cowl type neckline. I love the huge pockets yet they don’t make you look wider. I also love the super wide banded hemline. I am 5’9” 158 and my usual large fit perfect. I prefer to wear this with black fitted yoga sweats but I have it on with lighter colored leggings so you can see it easier. Of course you could wear it with leggings or sweats or even fleece tights and any color will work with a black dress which makes it even more versatile and fun. The length is great, not too long and dumpy looking and not too short that it shows your rear, it’s really perfect. It’s not a hot feeling dress, I usually wear a thin shirt underneath in cooler weather. It doesn’t make you sweat, it breathes like nothing else. This is cold wash light dry and it has no tags to scratch you, the washing instructions are printed inside. I have really enjoyed this piece and worn this so much already I would consider buying another if there were more colors. It’s a lot to spend I know, but good merino wool garments are never cheap but they last for years if you take care of them, I have some merino wool capes I’ve had for 30 years that still look like new and I wear them all winter. You can’t go wrong with this dress, it’s just fabulous!I highly recommend this one.",5,1,B08G74PTCZ,w-250-hooded-dress-long-parent,Womens,tops,"The medium can not be load.

I would wear this to the store and feel good in it. I love the seam on this, that ’ s what make it fit to your shape so nicely. It ’ s really good make, super soft medium thin weight nothing itchy about this and I have extremely sensitive skin. This have a hood with a cinch cord and a cowl type neckline. I love the huge pocket yet they don ’ t make you look wide. I also love the super wide band hemline. I be 5 ’ 9 ” 158 and my usual large fit perfect. I prefer to wear this with black fit yoga sweat but I have it on with light color legging so you can see it easy. Of course you can wear it with legging or sweat or even fleece tight and any color will work with a black dress which make it even much versatile and fun. The length be great, not too long and dumpy look and not too short that it show your rear, it ’ s really perfect. It ’ s not a hot feel dress, I usually wear a thin shirt underneath in cool weather. It doesn ’ t make you sweat, it breathe like nothing else. This be cold wash light spin-dry and it have no tag to scratch you, the wash instruction be print inside. I have really enjoy this piece and wear this so much already I would consider buy another if there be much color. It ’ s a lot to spend I know, but good merino wool garment be never cheap but they last for year if you take care of them, I have some merino wool cape I ’ have have for 30 year that still look like new and I wear them all winter. You can ’ t go wrong with this dress, it ’ s just fabulous! I highly recommend this one."

Merino wool has great insulating and wicking properties and unlike synthetics, it doesn't hang onto body odor.I really like this dress from Woolly. The merino wool is excellent quality and very soft and non-itchy. This dress has a generous weight and drapes nicely. The cut is really unique with seaming that adds visual interest and it curves in at the waist for a feminine fit.

I am typically a size 0 or XS in clothing and ordered this dress in my usual XS. The fit is great, so I would say it's true-to-size.Something to note is that, although they are labeling this as a dress, it is very short. It is shorter on me than the model in the description photos - although they say that she is 5'9"" and I'm 5'5"" which is odd. Maybe you get more length in the larger sizes.

The material is lighter weight 100% merino wool. When I first felt it, it seemed soft enough, but after wearing it and moving in it for a bit, it felt ""wooly"". It wasn't too itchy for me, I really didn't mind it and I love natural fibers, but I could see someone more sensitive not feeling comfortable in it for long periods of time because it does rub the skin in spots. It feels like the weight will be perfect for milder weather, it's breathable and not too heavy but substantial enough for a breeze. The cut of it shows lots of attention to detail. It's cut with women's curves in mind, it's not a straight bag style. The pockets are at the hips which are cut wider, so it does add a little bulk there, but it creates an hourglass look on me, which I appreciate. It has seams along the front and back that also create a shape. The neckline goes up higher but it's nice and loose, I hate hoodies that are tight in the neck. The hood is great, it has sides that go lower to slightly frame the face. If I'm putting my hood up, it's usually because it's raining and that will make a barrier so my hair and face don't get wet. I like how it fits, but I ordered a size up. I'm 5'9, 165lbs, 36ddd, normally a medium or 10, but I went with a large in this because it listed it as having an athletic fit and I didn't want it to be tight. If you're wanting it to fit a bit slouchy or if you're between sizes, definitely go up a size. If you want it form fitting, you can stick with your normal size.

It is thick enough to provide good coverage but is not at all thin or flimsy. I am 5'4"" tall and wear a size 14.

I read the reviews that suggest that it runs a little large so I thought I would go ahead and give it a try. I'm so glad I did because it ended up fitting me very well and while I am sure I will mostly be wearing it at home, I can definitely see wearing it out and about with a sweater or jacket and low heels. The fabric drapes beautifully without clinging. It has a loose, blousy fit on the top that I think is lovely and very feminine. It is more fitted on the bottom and it skims over any trouble spots.

There's one seam that go across the front on the bias and then two in the back. See the photo. They're embarrassingly bad. Like I would be embarrass if I work for this company and would be embarrass to wear this and embarrass to gift something like one of this three tank top to someone. To say I'm not impress with their quality control be a bite of a understatement. People often say you get what you pay for. In this case, I can't think of anyone desperate enough for merino clothe that they'd find Wooly product to be acceptable. Seriously, spend the extra $15 and get something that you would be proud to own. Life be too short to spend $40 be embarrass by your clothe. What a shame, because I really like their color."

She also knows that when winter starts to creep back in that the one hundred percent marino wool will keep her very warm. It has a detachable hood but I suggest washing it at the same time so the colors continue to match. It’s a well made jacket with multiple convenient pockets. Having the snaps and the zippered front just adds to the warmth on the inside and can be vented to disperse too much heat easily when needed. The overall stitching was consistent and straight and I didn’t find any manufacturing errors or loose threads anywhere to be snipped. Very good quality control at the source.

The jacket is lined in black fabric and is a nice contrast to the grey jacket which I have. To be honest I have to say the wool fabric reminds me of fabric used in men’s trousers. There are two good sized inside pockets, one open and the other zippered. The main zipper is quality and slides up and down with ease.  As for the outside pockets I find them to be a little strange almost as if the one of the pieces has been sewn on backwards – trying to slide your hand in the pockets is awkward.

You can't fit much but maybe your car key or something small. Two pockets and a tiny pocket in the front. The pockets don't stick out--the pants are very compact and streamlined.The Fit:I am 5'2"" about 116-117 and fit. These Woolly Clothing pants fit me well except at the waist--I have a small waist so I'm used to this but these are $99 pants. There's no belt loops to keep the back from sticking out. However, they didn't slide down my body either--I didn't have to keep pulling them up; they stayed put. The legs felt tight at first but as the day went on they loosened up. They fit me well in my hips and behind--in fact, they are flattering in their fit other than that waist that doesn't fit to my waist. They come below my belly button, slightly. There is a smooth line from waist to bottom of the leg, but I am pretty fit so there's not much of a 'muffin top' situation for me anyway. The length goes below my ankle but they aren't too long.The Not So Good:That waist that doesn't fit to my body (again, I'm used to this, but expected better). I can understand not having belt loops as these pants are very 'streamlined' but still, for $99 I was hoping for a better fit at the waist.Since you are not supposed to dry them in the dryer, they wrinkle - this went away when I put them on because they are so fitted on me. And, as well, when they are wet, they smell like wet wool--not real bad but they still did.The material is thin, which in a way is good as I didn't want thick wool pants, but I can actually almost see through the material if I hold them up to the light.They are a bit scratchy--I did not find them really soft. That scratchy feeling bothered me a lot when I first put them on until later I forgot about it.I would not pay $99 for these. I like them. They fit me well and flatter my body except at the waist. The color is nice. They are great for running errands, walking, maybe some kinds of hikes.

I have a few other items of clothing from Woolly and I've been impressed with the quality of the merino wool as well as the workmanship. These are no different. I initially thought these were meant to be a base layer, but in reading through the product description I realized they can be worn on their own as leggings. I wasn't entirely convinced, but decided to order them anyway. I am 5'4"" tall, wear a size 14 and ordered these in size XL. They fit just right -- not tight at all, but trim + they feel soft and and smooth and have a sleek look. I love merino wool and wear it all of the time, so I didn't anticipate that these leggings would irritate my skin at all, and they don't. The wool seems to be a medium weight -- I say this because have both lighter and heavier wool base layers (tops & bottoms) that are not directly comparable to this garment since they are specifically designed to be worn under clothing, but these leggings seem to be right in the middle. The fabric is 95% merino and 5% spandex; it is finely woven and it isn't heavy, but is not too thin and feels very soft. It has a nice drape and is much more opaque than I expected, so I don't really worry about them being see-through. The waistband is a double fold of fabric with a narrow elastic band that is well covered. The waistband is fairly wide and rests comfortably on my natural waist so these aren't high-waisted, but they also are not low-rise. The leggings have contoured flat seams and are gusseted for comfort and ease of movement. They are not the supportive, hold everything in place type of leggings, so I imagine they are probably best for women that are already fairly fit (which is not me). However, I feel confident enough wearing them with tunic length tops on my daily walks and they feel very nice on a cool day + I think they are flattering. The length extends to about 6"" above my ankles so these would work for me as a base layer with boots (which is why I actually bought these). I also like to wear them under my pjs because they often have wide legs creep up and don't keep me warm at night. I'm happy to have found these and they turned out to be more versatile than I expected. They are well made with perfectly sewn and finished seams and no loose or pulled threads. There are no pockets which is not a concern for me, but might be a concern for others.

It be about the same amount of stretch / see through as I've see in the same weight and weave of other brand like icebreaker and smartwool, so I think it be little about the specific quality of this legging and much a quality of merino wool cloth. Despite the sheer, this be warm than much of my thick yoga pant, which be what I be hope for. They, surprisingly for wool, seem to run a little big and stretch a little over time but snap back after wash. Due to sheer and stretch, I would not reach for this first for a yoga session. They do work amaze under dress, tunic length shirt, or pant for work or outdoor adventure on cold day, and after they've stretch from a few day of wear outside the house, they be the first thing I reach for to lounge in. Cat hair stick to this legging. look forward to much offering for lady - body from Woolly."

It is ok product for the price, but probably wouldn’t purchase this brand again.Update on my previous review: I have to give it one star. These leggings are incredibly itchy or a strange tingling sensation you feel after few hours of wearing them, by the end of the day all the sensation was so bad, all I can think of, how much I want to take them off, and  I wear a lot of merino wool clothing from several other brand like ibex and Icebreaker without any problems.

I guess I can still wear them on the top of another pair when it gets very cold.
